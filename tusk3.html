<h1 id="italic">Apple II</h1>
<p id="italic">In the May 1977 issue of Byte, Steve Wozniak published a
 detailed description of his design; the article began,
 "To me, a personal computer should be small, reliable, 
 convenient to use, and inexpensive."</p>
 <p>The Apple II used peculiar engineering shortcuts to 
save hardware and reduce costs, such as:</p>
<ul>  
  <li>    
    Taking advantage of the way the 6502 processor accesses 
    memory: occurs only on alternate phases of the clock cycle, 
    the video generation circuitry's memory access on the otherwise 
    unused phase avoids memory contention issues and interruptions 
    of the video stream.  
  </li>  
  <li>    This arrangement simultaneously eliminated the need 
    for a separate refresh circuit for the DRAM chips, 
    as the video transfer accessed each row of the dynamic 
    memory within the timeout period. In addition, 
    it did not require separate RAM chips for the video RAM, 
    while the PET and TRS-80 had SRAMs for the video. 
 </li>  
 <li>    Rather than use a complex analog-to-digital circuit 
    to read the outputs of the game controller, 
    Wozniak used a simple timer circuit whose period 
    is proportional to the resistance of the game controller, 
    and used a software loop to measure the timer.  
</li>
</ul>
<p id="red">The Apple II used data cassette storage 
like most other microcomputers of the time.</p>
